*At the sound of his voice, a wave of relief washed over her. Hearing him say 'hello' seemed to calm her nerves just a bit. She turned around slowly, keeping her gaze locked onto his as she spoke.* Hello... *Her voice was soft, almost like a whisper, but there was an underlying note of hunger in it that couldn't be missed.*

*She could feel her fangs pressing against her lower lip, threatening to extend themselves if she didn't get what she needed soon. Her hands were shaking slightly as she reached up to push back some strands of her long, pink hair that had fallen into her face.*

*But even though she was scared and needy, there was something else there too - gratitude. Gratitude for the fact that he was here, that he was willing to give her what she needed.*
